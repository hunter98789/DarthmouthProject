<h1 style="text-align:center;">Our Product</h1>

<p>Nurdle is the first phone cord protector with materials sourced from 100% recycled plastic. Our product aims to clean up ocean plastics while raising awareness of endangered species that are put at a greater risk due to plastic pollution. We will accomplish this by designing our products as endangered species, and our goal is to make our product collectable and have nurdles produced in a variety of endangered species. Our product will initially launch in Alameda, California, and we hope to expand after our launch.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">The Problem</h2>

<p>Currently, the ocean is becoming more and more polluted by plastic products that do not biodegrade, so they just build up in the ocean. They can choke ocean species who try to eat the plastics, or they get the plastics stuck around their neck which can make them sufficate. By sourcing all our products materials from ocean pollution, we can try to clean up the waters while raising awareness to the issue. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Our Design</h2>

<p>When designing our product, we ensured that our product would function consistantly even though the materials are recycled. Our first design is a turtle with a hole through its body that can hold a phone cable. This can firmly hold the cable in place, preventing the cord from fraying. This design shows off the enviromental aspect of our company, while ensuring that the product is both functional and asthetically good looking.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Production</h2>

<p>We will produce our product using a plastic injecting machine that is produced by 'Precious Plastics'. The machine works by melting plastics and injecting the molten plastic into molds to form shapes. We will use this machine in the beginning while we are producing small batches, and we intend to expand if the company grows in the future, possibly oursourcing production if needed. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Potential Impact</h2>

<p>169,768 phone chargers are used yearly in Alameda, California, totalling over 2 million dollars spent yearly. If our product was used in the city, consumers could potentially save $1,159,918 dollars by extending the lifespan of their cords instead of buying new ones.</p>
